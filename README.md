## About Me

I work at the intersection of **data, product, and growth**.

My work is centered around building:
- analytics dashboards that make metrics easy to act on  
- automated workflows that reduce manual effort  
- data pipelines that support product and marketing decisions  

I enjoy taking messy, real-world data and turning it into insights teams can actually use.

## Featured Project

### ETA Prediction and Last-Mile Delivery Optimization
🔗 [Repository](https://github.com/kairav11/Master_thesis)

Built and evaluated **ETA prediction models** using real-world logistics data.

Key highlights:
- Extensive EDA and feature engineering, including GPS and timestamp correction  
- Compared regression and ensemble models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost  
- Evaluated performance using MAE, RMSE, R², and tolerance-based accuracy metrics  
- Integrated spatio-temporal context such as traffic and weather  
- Found ensemble models to outperform deep learning approaches in sparse-data settings  

---

## Current Focus

- Building clearer, more actionable **BI dashboards**
- Improving **workflow automation** with n8n and CRM tools
- Applying **growth analytics frameworks** to product-led businesses
- Exploring data applications in **open-source and cybersecurity ecosystems**
